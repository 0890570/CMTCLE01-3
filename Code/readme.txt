A MySQL Database has been created for your project. You can use it with 
the following information:

database: prj_2015_2016_clemob_mt1bd_g
username: prj_2015_2016_clemob_mt1bd_g
password: eifieruv

You can use this information in your script to store information in the
database. And you can use it to administer your database through
https://sql.hosted.hro.nl/

Good luck to all!
